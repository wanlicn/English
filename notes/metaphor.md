# Figurative Language 
Figures of Speech / rhetorical Figures /比喻/修辞手法
: entails an intentional deviation from ordinary language use in order to produce a rhetorical effect.
## analogy 类比，比拟，类推：
## metaphor (隐喻): is/be
Directly refers to one thing by mentioning another. It may provide (or obscure) clarity or identify hidden similarities between two different ideas.

**A is B**
tenor/target/ground/metaphrand/(本体): 
vehicle/source/figure/metaphier/(喻体/载体):

**Pat is a tornado.**
however, a metaphier might have associated attributes or nuances – its paraphiers – that enrich the metaphor because they "project back" to the metaphrand, potentially creating new ideas – the paraphrands – associated thereafter with the metaphrand or even leading to a new metaphor.
